![The Microsoft Fabric Global AI HackTogether Banner](./images/FabricHackBanner3.png)

## Introduction

🛠️Build, innovate, and #HackTogether!🛠️ It's time to get started building AI solutions with Microsoft Fabric. 🔥

The Microsoft Fabric Global AI Hack is your playground for creating and experimenting with Microsoft Fabric. With mentorship from Microsoft experts and access to the latest tech, you will learn how to build AI solutions with Microsoft Fabric! The possibilities are endless for what you can create... plus you can submit your hack for a chance to win exciting prizes! 🥳

The hackathon starts on **February 15th** and ends on **March 4th** (just ahead of the [Microsoft Fabric Community Conference](https://fabricconf.com/)) - where one lucky winner will secure the honor of presenting to attendees during the Power Hour event!). It is recommended for participants to follow the Hack Together Roadmap for a successful hackathon.

## Hack Together Roadmap

Follow the steps below to successfully complete the hackathon.

### #00 - Prerequisites

**Register to for the Microsoft Fabric Global AI HackTogether event**: https://aka.ms/hacktogether/fabric-ai/register

**You will need to have access to a Microsoft Fabric capacity. If you don’t have one, you can obtain a Microsoft Fabric trial license by following these [instructions](https://aka.ms/upgrade-to-fabric).** 

**Introduce yourself**, we'd like to get to know you! 🥳 We will update with a link to the Fabric Community Hack Together Discussion forum on January 15 as we near closer to the event.

**Planning on hacking with Microsoft Fabric + Azure OpenAI?** We're able to offer no-cost, limited access to Azure OpenAI - no Azure account needed. We will have more details as we near closer to the event start date.

### #01 - Start hacking on February 15th
Either team up (max 3 team members) or fly solo to join the hacking! Make sure to [register for Hack Together](https://aka.ms/hacktogether/fabric-ai/register) before starting to build your project.

### #02 - Join live sessions for learning and inspiration

Note: These links will go live as we near the event start date.

### #03 - Submit your project until March 3rd 23:59 PM PST

You may submit your project here when it's ready: 🚀 [Project Submission](https://github.com/microsoft/hack-together-fabric-ai/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=project.yml&title=Project%3A+%3Cshort+description%3E)

Check out this video for step by step project submission guidance: [Project Submission Video](https://github.com/microsoft/hack-together-teams/assets/3199282/572ea387-61ec-4b77-9885-23b5b2bd39bd)

There will be a grand prize winner out of all projects as well as a 'Best Real-World AI application built with Microsoft Fabric', 'Best use of Microsoft Fabric + Azure OpenAI', and 'Best use of Copilot for Microsoft Fabric' so it is important to align your hack to one of these categories.

We'd love to hear about your project, tell us what you are working on!

For a great example of a community developed solution that demonstrates a high-quality submission for this Hackathon, check out:  

[Tracking International Space Station with Microsoft Fabric](https://github.com/anshulsharmas/fabric-iss-demo)

This solution is a great example because it:
* Solves a real-world problem in a novel way using Microsoft Fabric
* Is shared publicly via a GitHub repo
* Has clear documentation and instructions to reproduce the solution 
* Includes a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HhU7yLyuUU) demonstrating the solution in action

That said, this solution could be better aligned to the Hackathon by:
* Incorporating Azure OpenAI into the solution
* Making use of Copilot for Fabric features
